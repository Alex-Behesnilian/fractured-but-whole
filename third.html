			<h1><center>What are the lanes?<center></h1>
			The lanes within League of Legends are basically the roles each player plays within the game. There
			is the top lane, middle lane, bottom lane and the jungle. The top, center and jungle lanes usually consists of one player and
			the bottom lane consists of two players.
			
			
			<h1><center>What type of champion goes into each lane:</center></h3>
			To strategically play League of Legends you need to follow the meta which is the best style of play for
			the game for that month. The top lane consists of one strong, high health champion that can soak and deal a lot 
			of damage. The center lane consists of a mage against a mage. The bottom lane consists of a marksman and a support 
			that go hand in hand against two other opponents and the jungle consists of another high health champion that can
			soak and deal a lot of damage except the jungle goes all around and supports every lane.
