			<h1><center>Why I chose League of Legends:</center></h3>
			I started playing League of Legends during the summer with a few of my friends as it is listed one of
			the top MMORPG games today. I think its a really fun and strategic game to play that doesn't require too much
			effort. The more you play the more you want to play as you get better and better.
