			<h1><center>Who is my favorite champion?<center></h1>
			My favorite champion is the one displayed on the background. His name is Teemo. Teemo has
			5 special skills. His first skill is that he turns invisible if he starts moving and the opponent
			is blind to him. The second skill is a blinding dart that negates any atttack from the opponent.
			The third skill allows him to run faster making him impossible to catch and the fourth skill is 
			laying down mushroom bombs that explode and poison the opponent. All in all Teemo is one annoying champion.
			
			
			<h1><center>Difference of Champions:</center></h3>
			There are 5 different types of champions in League of Legends: Support, Tank, Assassin, Marksman and Mage.
			The goal of the Tank is to soak as much damage as possible from all other champions. Much like a heavy duty tank
			used in the army. The Assassin sneaks his way behind the lower health champions to assassinate them before they can
			do anything to anyone. The marksman is usually a range champion that damages other champions from afar. The support
			is mainly used to support the marksman that generally has low health and the main objective of the mage is to cause
			as much chaos as possible disorienting the enemy team.
